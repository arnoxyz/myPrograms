    <h2>Description</h2>
    I3 is a window tiling manager that is lightweight, fast and fun to work with.
    <h2>Basics</h2>
    To get startet just install it on your computer. You need to run a linux system to install it as far as I know. Restart your system and on the log in screen you normaly can just choose it. On the first start the configure-wizard will automatically start and it is possible to choose the default mod key. This can be windows or the  alt key. I choose the alt key because on my small keyboard the alt key is just easier to press, but most people choose the windows key and the windows key is also the default. Now the most basic things to just get startet working with i3.
    <ul>
	    <li>open a terminal with: <b>mod+enter</b>, now open another terminal just press the combination again</li>
	    <li>close a terminal by just typing exit or with <b>mod+shift+q</b> I remember that with just q stands for quit</li>
	    <li>open a program. <b>mod+d</b>, this opens on the top the program manager. Just type in a program name and it will open that program</li>
	    <li>at the start just jump with <b>mod+j</b> to the next window</li>
	    <li>jump to a workspace [number] with <b>mod+[number]</b> there are per default 10 workspaces starting with 1,2,3 and so on</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why is this good?</h2>
    <ul>
	    <li>much better overview of what is going on</li>
	    <li>use 100% of your screen</li>
	    <li>switch between workspaces and get your stuff organized</li>
	    <li>it is fun</li>
    </ul>
