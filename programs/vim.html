    <h2>Description</h2>
    VIM is a lightweight text editor that can nearly everything you can imagine. It's fast, customable and runs on every unix platform.
    <h2>Basics</h2>
    To get startet just install it on your device and run <b>vim [fileName]</b> on your cli. The best thing at the beginning is just to run the <b>vimtutor</b>. This will get you going and will explain you the basics but for the start here are the three most important things in vim.
    <ul>
	<li><b>i</b> stands for insert or <b>a</b> for append to get into the insert mode. Here it is just as you normal editor expirience.</li>
	<li>press <b>escape</b> or <b>ctrl+c</b> to get out of the insert mode in the normal mode. Move now with <b>h</b>,<b>j</b>,<b>k</b>,<b>l</b></li>
	<li>get out of vim with. <b>:wq</b> (when in normal mode, wq stands for write and quite if you dont want to save the file then just <b>:q!</b>) or <b>ZZ</b> </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why is this good?</h2>
    <ul>
	    <li>you can edit and configure text files in a blink of an eye</li>
	    <li>you can custome and learn even more stuff</li>
	    <li>the basic vi editor is everywhere available. This will come in handy when you work on a machine that does not have a gui like for example a server</li>
	    <li>you can automate stuff like write your own shortcuts and much more</li>
	    <li>it is fun</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>More stuff</h2>
    <ul>
	<li><b>dit</b> (delete in tag) or <b>cit</b> (clear in tag) removes the content when the position is in an tag in html</li>
	<li> open the html file in the browser with <b>:! gio open index.html</b> (! = is used when starting a command outside of vim, as for me a bash command), gio open is the basic way to open the default program in ubuntu, but it would also work with <b>:! firefox index.html</b> or <b>:! google-chrome index.html</b> </li>
    </ul>
