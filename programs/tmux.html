    <h2>Description</h2>
    TMUX stands for terminal multiplexer. When you often work with terminals and you open another terminal and then another one and another one. One thing about it is really annoying. It is just a bad overview. Also when you want to save a setting for example your amazing self customized ide with gdb and three text files at once open, you want to log out on your system and want to start on the next day at the same point you were leaving. Also you and your friends want to coloberate in real time and editing a file. All this can the tmux do. Here I will shortly explain the basics just to get going.
    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <ul>
	    <li>start tmux in your cli by just typing <b>tmux</b></li>
	    <li>the default keybinding for the action is <b>ctrl+b</b>, so on everything you do just press <b>ctrl+b</b> and then the key. I will call this now on <b>mod-key</b></li>
	    <li>press the <b>mod-key</b> and then <b>"</b> to create another terminal under your current terminal.
	    <li>jump between your two terminals with <b>mod-key></b> and <b>o</b>, this is for the beginning just enough to get going with jumping</li>
	    <li>you also can split the window with <b>mod-key</b> and <b>%</b>, now on the right side of the terminal should be another terminal, jumping is the same as before.</li>
	    <li>now to create another windo press <b>mod-key</b> and <b>c</b> for create</li>
	    <li>you see that on the bottom there is now another tab. To get to the next tab just press <b>mod-key</b> and <b>n</b> for next or <b>p</b> for previus.</li>
    </ul>
